# NLE challenge baseline using sample-factory

An openly shared baseline code for the [NeurIPS 2021 Nethack challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2021-the-nethack-challenge/), using [sample-factory](https://github.com/alex-petrenko/sample-factory) in its core. Feel free to use in your submissions as you see fit! This code only works on Linux.

Core features:
- Trains two billion (2e9) steps in 22h on a single RTX 2080Ti and 16 2.3Ghz cores. This reaches an average of 700-800 and a median of 400 reward.
- Learning algorithm is asynchronous PPO (see sample-factory for detailed explanation) with V-trace. Network consists of separate input heads and an RNN core (using GRUs).
- Main observation is an RGB image around the player character, rendered with `obs_wrappers.RenderCharImagesWithNumpyWrapper`, processed with a standard CNN used with Atari experiments.
- Agent also receives the `blstats` observation, normalized with manually set normalization weights, and the `message` observation. Both are processed with a two-layer network before the RNN. This does not do proper text processing for `message`, but at least allows it to detect common situations, e.g. "It is a wall". These encodings are concatenated with image encoding before the RNN core.


## Installation and training an agent

Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run code with `./train_baseline.sh`. This should start printing out text about initializing the workers, and eventually learning statistics. Training lasts for two billion steps.

**Note:** by default this will continue the training with the files already contained in this repository. Change the experiment name in `train_baseline.sh` or alternatively remove `train_dir` directory to train a new model.

You can try to speed up training by changing the `num_workers` and `num_envs_per_worker` parameters inside `train_baseline.sh`.

## Submitting to AICrowd

This repository contains necessary files to make a submission, including a pretrained model. Simply follow the [official instructions on doing a submission](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/nethack/neurips-2021-the-nethack-challenge/-/blob/master/docs/SUBMISSION.md), and you should be good to go! Remember to update the `aicrowd.json`!

Checklist of things for changing your trained models for submission:
- Update `train_dir` to only contain the experiment you want to submit (and preferably only one checkpoint file. `cfg.json` is a necessary file!)
- Make sure the experiment name in `run.sh` matches one in `train_baseline.sh`.

## Contents

- `main.py`: entry point for training.
- `evaluate.py`: entry point for (AICrowd) evaluation.
- `env.py`: core environment wrappers and creation of environment in sample-factory
- `obs_wrappers.py`: code for drawing RGB images of the NLE and processing `blstats` info.
- `models.py`: torch model for encoding observations before the RNN core.
- `train_baseline.sh`: run training with the default settings.
- `run.sh`, `apt.txt`, `aicrowd.json`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`: files necessary for the [AICrowd submission](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/nethack/neurips-2021-the-nethack-challenge).


## Wandb integration

By default the sample-factory stores logs as tensorboard files, but to ease up tracking, this code comes with Weights & Biases integration.

Simply define `WANDB_API_KEY` variable in the environment and install wandb (`pip install wandb`), and you should start seeing logs on the wandb page once you launch the code.
